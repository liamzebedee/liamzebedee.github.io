I'm really enjoying the power ReactJS has afforded me these past few days in my exploration of it. I've been undergoing a major refactor of GigCove's frontend UI code, because whenever I've been trying to edit it I've been swamped with the daunting task of JQuery selector hell/BS. 

For those who are not quite yet aware, JQuery selector hell is a condition I give to the loose coupling between the HTML view and the interactivity of the backend JS, which is all horridly linked together by these CSS selectors in quite a messy manner.

ReactJS has completely ameliorated my situation.
